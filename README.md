## Existing Features

- __Welcome screen__

An imported figlet library (pyfiglet) is used to create the text banner from standard characters. This large banner is clear and lets the user know what game they are playing. The image of the hangman (also made from characters), is instantly recognisable as the well know hangman game. The user is prompted to input their name on this screen.

- __Error single letter only__

Similar to the error letters only, if the user is to type a number of characters into the terminal, the validator function will print an error message letting the player know that only one letter can be input at a time.

- __Correct letter__

If the player inputs a correct letter, it will be inserted into the underscored line in as many places as the letter exists, the user will be informed by name that the guess was correct. This letter will also be placed in the letters guessed line so they can keep track of what has already been guessed.

- __Incorrect letter__

If the letter input is incorrect the printed message informs the user that the letter is not in the word and that a life has been lost. This letter will then be printed into the letters guessed line to allow the user to see all the letters they have guessed. For each incorrect letter and life lost the hangman will gain a body part.ÃŸ

- __Hint__

The player can request a hint by typing hint into the guess a letter box. The validator has an exception which allows the word (even though more than character) to be input, when this is done , the definition of the word is shown to the user. The hint can be displayed at an point throughout the game.
